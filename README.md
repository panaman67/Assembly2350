# Assembly2350
x86 assembly language in MASM/NASM for TTU assembly class

Project.asm instructions:
Create an assembly program that will calculate a user's choice of either combination orpermutation.
 -Your main procedure will print a menu for the user and read their input.
      factorial, combination and permutation.
 -Factorial should be a recursively defined procedure that takes an integer argument
      (passed on the stack) and returns it's factorial.
 -The combination and permutation procedures will use the factorial procedure
      that you create in order to perform their calculations.
 -After each selection the user should be asked if they would like to perform another operation.
 -If they enter "yes" (not just 'y') they should be able to continue.
 -Otherwise, the program should exit
